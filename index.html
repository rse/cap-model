The CAP model was developed for being applied in the following four use cases:

<ul>
    <li><b>Career Self-Assessment</b>:&nbsp;
        Everybody has different skills and is at an individual career
        level in the profession. CAP allows you to better figure out how
        mature you already are in your profession as a whole and in the
        disciplines your profession breaks down to.
    </li>
    <li><b>Foundation for Company Skill Matrix</b>:&nbsp;
        Most larger companies have a knowledge base with a skill
        matrix (employees-axis, skill-axis, competence-cells), which can
        be used by managers for reasonable project staffing. The CAP
        model can be perfectly used as the underlying competence metric
        for such a skill matrix.
    </li>
    <li><b>Indication for Company Job Model</b>:&nbsp;
        Most companies have job models which usually at least
        distinguishes between job levels. During an application, an
        assessment based on CAP allows a manager to get a reasonable
        indication which existing job level would be appropriate for the
        applicant.
    </li>
    <li><b>Indication for Employee Ranking Process</b>:&nbsp;
        Most larger companies have an annual employee ranking process,
        which usually is at least one of the essential inputs for the
        promotion process. During the ranking process, assessments based
        on CAP allows a manager to get a better indication of the relative
        rank between employees.
    </li>
</ul>

                </div>
                <div class="g-col-7-12 text">
The CAP model always is applied to a particular competence context. This
can be an arbitrary context, but typical contexts are:

<ul>
    <li>a <b>Profession</b><br> (for instance: Computer Science),</li>
    <li>a <b>Discipline</b> within a profession<br> (for instance: Software Architecture), or</li>
    <li>a <b>Technology</b> or <b>Methodology</b> within a discipline<br> (for instance: Java Programming Language or Effort Estimation).</li>
</ul>

The main difference between those competence contexts just is the actual
duration one needs until one reaches the 100% competence level (Guru).
From experience we know that for a profession it usually is about 20
years, for a discipline it usually is about 8 years and for a technology
or methodology it usually is about 2 years.

                </div>
                <div class="g-col-7-12 text">

In CAP, we distinguish between four competence streams which
orthogonally span the competence coordination system.

<ul>
    <li><b>Knowledge</b>:&nbsp;
      competence through knowledge, indicated by
      the amount of bare theoretical knowledge you receive about the competence context.
      Knowledge is usually achieved by actively reading and studying or by passively being trained.
    </li>
    <li><b>Practicability</b>:&nbsp;
      competence through practicability, indicated by
      the amount of current knowledge you effectively apply at least once in practice.
      Practicability is usually achieved by at least once exploring or testing knowledge in
      practice, even if it is still done in a non-real world environment.
    </li>
    <li><b>Experience</b>:&nbsp;
      competence through experience, indicated by
      the amount of distinguished practical use cases of the competence context you experience in practice.
      Experience is usually achieved by the repeated application of Knowledge and Practicability in real-world environments.
    </li>
    <li><b>Leadership</b>:&nbsp;
      competence through leadership, indicated by
      the degree you are able to advance the state-of-the-art or body-of-knowledge of the competence context.
      Leadership is usually achieved by developing models, crafting solutions, training others or publishing own findings.
    </li>
</ul>

In CAP, we distinguish between five competence levels
which serve as the final main classification of a person:

<ul>
    <li><b>Novice</b>:&nbsp;
      You start as a Novice when you enter CAP. This phase usually lasts
      for the first 10% of time until you can be a Guru. In this phase you
      usually strongly focus on the Knowledge competence stream only and
      just start with the Practicability stream.
    </li>

    <li><b>Practitioner</b>:&nbsp;
      You are at the Practitioner level between 10% and 25% of the time
      until you can be a Guru in the competence context. This level
      already lasts a little bit longer than the Novice level. In this
      phase you usually strongly focus on the Practicability competence
      stream, just start with the Experience competence stream and finish
      the Knowledge competence stream.
    </li>

    <li><b>Master</b>:&nbsp;
      You are the Master level between 25% and 50% of the time until you can
      be a Guru. This level usually lasts as long as the Novice and
      Practitioner levels together. In this phase you usually strongly
      focus on the Experience competence stream and just start with the
      Leadership stream.
    </li>

    <li><b>Expert</b>:&nbsp;
      You are at the Expert level between 50% and 100% of the time until
      you can be a Guru. This level usually lasts as long as the Novice,
      Practitioner and Master levels together. In this phase you usually
      strongly focus on the Leadership competence stream while you still
      continuously extend the Experience competence stream.
    </li>

    <li><b>Guru</b>:&nbsp;
      Finally you are at the Guru level. This level lasts forever. In
      this phase you usually already primarily focus on other competence
      contexts, but still regularily extend the Experience and Leadership
      competence streams in this competence context. 
    </li>
</ul>

                </div>
                <div class="g-col-7-12 text">

In CAP, the competence achievement can be distinguished on the
four competence streams:

<ul>
   <li><b>On Knowledge competence stream</b>:&nbsp;
      At the time you start as a Novice, the whole body-of-knowledge of the
      competence context counts as 100%. The Knowledge achievement level
      then indicates how much of this initial knowledge you receive over
      time. As the body-of-knowledge of a competence context usually extends
      over time in parallel, you can effectively achieve more than 100% in
      the long-term. 
      <p/>
      You usually follow the following milestones:
      <ol>
          <li>You start as a Novice with 0% achievement and 0% competence.</li>
          <li>You boost up to already 50% Knowledge achievement when you become Practitioner at 10% competence.</li>
          <li>You already reach 100% Knowledge achievement when you become Master at 25% competence.</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li><b>On Practicability competence stream</b>:&nbsp;
      The Practicability achievement level indicates how much of your
      current Knowledge you already applied at least once in practice.
      Although your Knowledge over time extends 100%, you will never be
      able to apply more than 100% of this Knowledge in practice, of
      course.
      <p/>
      You usually follow the following milestones:
      <ol>
         <li>You already reach 20% Practicability achievement when you become Practitioner at 10% competence.</li>
         <li>You boost up to already 80% Practicability achievement when you become Master 25% competence.</li>
         <li>You reach 100% Practicability achievement when you become Expert at 50% competence.</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li><b>On Experience competence stream</b>:&nbsp;
      At the time you start as a Novice, the known possible use cases of
      the competence context count as 100%. The Experience achievement
      level indicates how many of these initial possible use cases of the
      competence context you experience repetitive in practice. As new
      possible use cases are discovered over time, you will be able to
      experience more than 100% in the long-term.
      <p/>
      You usually follow the following milestones:
      <ol>
         <li>You already reach 20% Experience achievement when you become Master at 25% competence.</li>
         <li>You boost up to already 60% Experience achievement when you become Expert 50% competence.</li>
         <li>You slowly reach 100% Experience achievement during becoming a Guru.</li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <li><b>On Leadership competence stream</b>:&nbsp;
      The Leadership achievement level indicates how much you are advancing
      the current state-of-the-art or body-of-knowledge of the competence
      context yourself. Although the state-of-the-art might change over
      time, you will never be able to advance more than 100% of a competence
      discipline, of course.
      <p/>
      You usually follow the following milestones:
      <ol>
          <li>You already reach 20% Experience achievement when you become Master at 25% competence.</li>
          <li>You boost up to already 60% Experience achievement when you become Expert 50% competence.</li>
          <li>You slowly reach 100% Experience achievement during becoming a Guru.</li>

For self-assessment, CAP is usually used the following way:

<ol>
   <li><b>Determine Context</b>:&nbsp; You decide whether your competence context to assess 
       is your profession, a discipline of your profession or
       or a technology or methodology within a discipline of
       your profession.</li>
   </li>
   <li><b>Get Initial Indication</b>:&nbsp; To get an early indicator, you check the amount of time
       you have already investigated into the competence context
       and locate a X-position on the year-timeline corresponding 
       to the competence context.
   </li>
   <li><b>Fine-Tune Achievement Level</b>:&nbsp; Now you look upwards to the four competence streams and
       adjust your initial X-position according to the
       achievement levels you actually reached.
   </li>
   <li><b>Know Your Competence Level</b>:&nbsp; According to the X-position you now know what competence
       level (N, P, M1, M2, E1, E2, E3, E4, or G) you have in
       the assessed competence context.

</ol>
